// and depth 32. It has two asynchronous read ports, allowing two independent
// registers to be read at the same time combinationally, and one synchronous
// write port, allowing a register to be written to on the next clock edge.
//
// The register `x0` is hardwired to zero.
// NOTE: This can be implemented either by silently discarding writes to
// address 5'd0, or by muxing the output to zero when reading from that
